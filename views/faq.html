          <h1>What is Rush?</h1>
          <p>Rush is a time period to get to know what the sorority is all about, our goals, and what it means to us, as well as to get to know the sisters of the sorority through events hosted by us. It’s a time to just relax and have fun, get to know new people with no obligations or commitments. All events are free and optional for interested girls. We encourage any girls with even a little interest to come check out the largest nationwide Asian-American interest sorority in the world!</p>

            <h1>What is a bid and how do I get one?</h1>
            <p>A bid is an invitation to begin the new member process. We encourage girls to be engaged and be themselves when coming out to our rush events. Talking to as many sisters on a personal level is extremely helpful for both you and us – we can make a well informed decision on whether to extend a bid to you, and you are able to assess more clearly whether aKDPhi is right for you. Keep in mind that in order to qualify for an interview, one must attend 2 rush events, an informational meeting, as well as our bi-annual potluck.</p>

            <h1>Do I have to be Asian to join?</h1>
             <p>Absolutely not. Although we are an Asian-interest sorority, we in no ways limit ourselves to just those of Asian heritage. We welcome anyone of all races, lifestyles, age, grade, state or country. Across the nation, we have a great diversity of ethnicities outside the Asian culture including African-Americans, Caucasians, and Latino-Americans. Asian-interest simply means that you envision the same goals and care about the same issues. We also encourage any incoming freshmen who are adjusting to college life and just want to meet new people!</p>

            <h1>What is expected of a new member?</h1>
            <p>The purpose of sorority education consists of education about the sorority and chapter. New members should demonstrate a desire and ability to support alpha Kappa Delta Phi’s sorority standards. Hazing, defined as “any action taken or situation created to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule,” is not condoned nor tolerated.</p>

            <h1>What is a legacy?</h1>
            <p>A legacy refers to someone who is an immediate family member of one of our sisters. We extend all of our support and welcome into our sisterhood our sister’s sisters and daughters. When an immediate family member rushes the sorority, her family member should inform the chapter of the legacy status. However, a chapter may ultimately decline membership to a legacy if she does not meet the new member criteria set by the chapter.</p>

            <h1>Are there scholarships?</h1>
            <p>Yes! Our National Alumnae Board hopes to contribute to the successful future of exemplary active sisters who continue to uphold the standards and integrity of alpha Kappa Delta Phi. NAB currently offers a scholarship program in which actives can apply for at their <a href="www.akdphialum.org" >website</a>. At the University of Illinois, our alumnae provide scholarships for the active sisters every year.</p>

          <h1>Why aKDPhi?</h1>
          <p>αΚΔΦ (aKDPhi, or alpha Kappa Delta Phi) is the largest and only international Asian-American interest sorority. With 53 chapters (and still growing), there are huge networking opportunities for every sister of aKDPhi. This ranges from job connections when one becomes an alumna to having a place to stay when one travels. The bonds of sisterhood that our organization has are extremely strong and stress the five traditions of the sorority – sisterhood, scholarship, leadership, service, and Asian awareness. aKDPhi is a family away from home and it is the epitome of a friendship that lasts a lifetime.<br></br>

          Our chapter consistently holds one of the highest GPAs in the United Greek Council and our sisters come from a diverse range of majors, from communications to premed. aKDPhi provides a variety of leadership opportunities, with sisters becoming leaders in the APA community, United Greek Council, and most importantly, within our own organization. Our chapter also has a strong passion for being involved within both the Champaign-Urbana and university community.<br></br>

          The sisters of aKDPhi are constantly doing various service projects in the local community, volunteering at Wesley Food Pantry as part of our chapter philanthropy as well as cleaning our adopted highway. We also stress our national philanthropy – Breast Cancer Awareness (Avon Breast Cancer Crusade) – holding our annual Breast Cancer Date Auction in October and participating in Race for the Cure and Walk for Hope in Chicago, which are walks that both advocate breast cancer awareness. Each year we help by donating over $1000 to the cause. Among these things, aKDPhi has good relationships with other organizations both at UIUC and from other campuses. We have many socials with other Greek organizations, and sisters are involved in other student clubs that allow our chapter to get involved in other issues as well.</p>
